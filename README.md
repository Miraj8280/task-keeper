## Project Description

In the project, I've created a Complete Todo Application with all features using `React.js` and to manage our states, I used `Redux`. Also to make simple animations used `Framer Motion`.

## Features
* Check box for done/undone.
* Unfinished task list view.
* Done task list view.
* Edit the task.
* Delete the task.
* Appears a pop-up after adding/deleting task.
* Sorted by time & date (most recent on the top).
* Status for complete/incomplete.
* Hitting the refresh button do not cause any change.
* Works like regular offline app.
* Easy to use interface.
